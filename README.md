A simple movie recommendations app, built as extra credit for Georgia Tech's CS2340 course

This app was built as a clone for the Android movie recommendations application built during the Spring 2016 semester of Georgia Tech's CS2340 course.

**Fair warning**: This project is shoddily coded and will not be supported in the future. This is just a prototype that can be fleshed out if desired.
